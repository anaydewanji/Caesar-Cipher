*Caesar Cipher*

The Caesar Cypher method is one of the oldest methods of ecryption and decryption.
It includes shifting each letter of the text by the key or shift value.

During it's time it was one of the safest methods of encryption and decryption.
Nowdays, other methods have left this method far behind.
As well as that, it is insecure due to things like AI, and advanced decryption methods.

Even though it cannot be used for professional secure messages, you can still use it!
