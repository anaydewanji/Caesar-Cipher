The Caesar Cypher method is one of the oldest methods of ecryption and decryption.
It includes shifting each letter in the sentence up or down in the alphabet by the shift value.
It was invented by the Former Roman Dictator **Julius Caesar**(July 100 BCE - March 14 BCE)

During it's time it was one of the safest methods of encryption and decryption.
Nowdays, other methods have left this method far behind.
As well as that, it is insecure due to things like AI, and advanced decryption methods.

Even though it cannot be used for professional secure messages, you can still use it!
